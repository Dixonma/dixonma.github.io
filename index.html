    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Hiüëãüèæ, I‚Äôm Makiah ‚Äî a passionate learner with skills in Python, Flask, HTML, and CSS. I enjoy creating practical, useful projects that solve real-world problems while helping me grow my technical abilities. I‚Äôm currently pursuing a degree in Computer Science with a focus on Cybersecurity, and gaining hands-on experience through coursework, personal projects, and customer service roles. My strengths include problem-solving, communication, teamwork, and a growing foundation in programming, data analysis, and information security. I‚Äôm actively seeking internship or entry-level opportunities to continue learning and contribute to a team.
Outside of school and tech, I enjoy exploring new cultures and traveling. You‚Äôll often find me at the movies, playing video games, taking walks to recharge, or spending quality time with my family.</p>
